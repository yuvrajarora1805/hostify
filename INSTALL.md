## 📦 Installing Hostify as a Python Library

### Option 1: Install from Local Directory (Development)

```bash
cd d:\xamp\htdocs\hostify
pip install -e .
```

This installs hostify in "editable" mode, so you can make changes and they'll be reflected immediately.

### Option 2: Install from GitHub (After Publishing)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/hostify.git
```

### Option 3: Install from PyPI (After Publishing)

```bash
pip install hostify
```

## 🚀 Using Hostify in Your Projects

### Example 1: Host an Existing Server

```python
from hostify import Host

# Your Flask/Node/PHP app is already running on port 3000
Host(
    domain="app.example.com",
    port=3000
).serve()
```

### Example 2: Host Static Files

```python
from hostify import Host

# Serve static files from a directory
Host(
    domain="mysite.example.com",
    path="./public"
).serve()
```

### Example 3: With Custom API Token

```python
from hostify import Host

Host(
    domain="app.example.com",
    port=5000,
    api_token="your_cloudflare_api_token_here"
).serve()
```

---

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### 1. Cloudflare API Token

Create a token at: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

**Required Permissions:**
- Account → Cloudflare Tunnel → Edit
- Zone → DNS → Edit
- Zone → Zone → Read

**Set the token:**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:CF_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Linux/Mac
export CF_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### 2. Domain in Cloudflare

Make sure your domain is added to Cloudflare and nameservers are configured.

---

## 📝 Complete Example: Flask App

**app.py:**
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello from my old PC!</h1>"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

**host.py:**
```python
from hostify import Host

# Make sure app.py is running first!
Host(
    domain="flask.example.com",
    port=5000
).serve()
```

**Run:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
python app.py

# Terminal 2
python host.py
```

Your app is now live at `https://flask.example.com`! 🎉

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No server found on port X"
Make sure your application is running before starting hostify.
